# html2scalajs-react (alpha)

## Convert HTML to [Scala.JS-react](https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react)!

* Go to [https://mardo.github.io/html2scalajs-react/](https://mardo.github.io/html2scalajs-react/)
* Copy-paste HTML into the text area
* Click the "Convert" button
* Profit

## Why is this alpha?

Currently, the code is very simple. It has not being tested with any large or complex HTML; it should work, but if it doesn't [please open an issue](https://github.com/mardo/html2scalajs-react/issues/new) :)

Anyway, in the worst case scenario, it should give you a good starting point for you to just change small parts.
